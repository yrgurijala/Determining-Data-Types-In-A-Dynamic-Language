# DeterminingDataTypesInADynamicLanguage

- This Program uses regular expression to recognize identifiers, numbers and strings. 
- This program will use a simplified context-free grammar to recognize arithmetic expressions with ’+’. In order to detect data types, I had to perform a partial evaluation using an attribute grammar to extend the parse tree. The data types in Python is: bool, int, str, list, undefined.
